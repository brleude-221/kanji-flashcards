- visuals 
- when all of the words have been studied stop showing the know don't know and undo buttons until a new file is chosen 
- below the meaning button and above the know don't know and undo add a button called sentence if the loaded file has 4 columns
It should display the corresponding sentence from the 4th column 
When displaying the unknown I don't want this column to be displayed but when saving the unknown I want it to be saved if it originally existed
